interface \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_model_1_1_feature_1_1_i_body}{IBody}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Interface for a feature that is represented by multiple points on a map and can contain elements by position. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
interface \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_model_1_1_feature_1_1_i_feature}{IFeature}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Interface for a feature that is represented by multiple points on a map. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_model_1_1_feature_1_1_simple_water_body}{Simple\+Water\+Body}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A simple body of water, that fills a valley to a certain height of a selected position. Does not support refilling, collision, removing water and creating from a certain volume. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_model_1_1_feature_1_1_sun}{Sun}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class represents a sun in the game, which is a feature of a map, and heats up the map depending on different parameters. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_model_1_1_feature_1_1_water_body}{Water\+Body}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A complex water body that can be filled by a specific amount of water. It will create overflows if the water would in nature flow over the edge of the water body. It also supports merging with other water bodies. Does not support splitting or removing water. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
